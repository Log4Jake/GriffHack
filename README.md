# Griff-Hack
***I am not liable for any misuse of this code.***A working hack for hacking cloud games on scratch, this project is particularly focused on Griffpatch's Minecraft-ish project.

## Instructions
### Step 1 - Cloning/remixing
Start by going to Griffpatch's Original [Minecraft-ish](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/843162693) project. Click the ![image](https://github.com/Log4Jake/GriffHack/assets/62357760/7bce9d28-bc96-4d5a-b3c3-1f03c32a49d7) button to clone the project.
### Step 2 - Populating the variables
Open the project and click the ![image](https://github.com/Log4Jake/GriffHack/assets/62357760/d81a2ced-7a68-4528-8723-50605a2acd71) to start the project. This is to populate the cloud variables in the project. ***You will need to do the same thing later on the Turbowarp project.***
### Step 3 - Editing the python code
• Download and extract this repo. Edit the griff-hack.py file with your favorite text/code editor.

• Start by adding your username

• Then add your [sessionID](https://github.com/TimMcCool/scratchattach/wiki/Get-your-session-id)

• Add your remixed project ID where necessary.

• Add the original project ID where necessary. (if you need to change it)

• Save the file.

• Open your remixed project in turbo warp.

• Go to the edit tab and click change username.

• Change the username to `griffpatch`

• Click the ![image](https://github.com/Log4Jake/GriffHack/assets/62357760/d81a2ced-7a68-4528-8723-50605a2acd71) to start the project. This is to populate the cloud variables in the project.

### Step 5 - Becoming Griffpatch

• Open the original project and the remixed on in turbo warp in separate windows. Make sure they are both running.

• Run the python script a few times to start the hack.

• You should be able to fly on the turbowarp by hitting the `↑` 2 or 3 times quickly. You can pick blocks by hitting `E`. He also has some custom chat messages.

• On the scratch project you will be able to see yourself (griffpatch) but on turbowarp you cannot see players or their data. You can place blocks and fly and they will appear on scratch.
